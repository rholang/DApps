Hello! This is kind of a dummy directory. The files in this dir are **only** used as placeholder URLs. For example, /community/faq, per docusaurus, would go to the file `community/faq/index.js`.

We do this because that `index.js` file has logic that in turn calls `static/js/redirect.js`, which maps stale URLs from the old doc site to the new one. Reminder: /community/faq/ isn't an actual URL anymore; the faq page of the new docs live under /docs/en/community/faq.html.
