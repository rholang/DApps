Our community member [@astrada](https://github.com/astrada) has helped us integrate ReasonReact's JSX and (runtime) library support into this site's Try page! It wasn't a small feat, so thank you @astrada.

Now you can try any ReasonReact snippet in the playground and things should Just Work. If you ever need a convenient ReasonReact template, there's one in the Examples menu.

Enjoy!
