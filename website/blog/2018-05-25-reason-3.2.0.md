title: Reason 3.2.0!
---

_This release should be used in conjunction with `bs-platform 3.1.4`_.

Rejoice! The release you've all been waiting for. This fixes bring three **major** quality-of-life improvements when using Reason's formatter, `refmt`.

## Whitespace Tuning

**Your empty lines will now be preserved** when you format your code! Multiple lines still collapse into one in most cases.

This also mean that those awkward, forced new lines refmt previously inserted between e.g. top-level statements are now gone too (unless you insert them yourself). Here's an example snippet where whitespaces are preserved as-is:

```reason
let confName = "Reason Conf";

let month = "May";
let year = "2018";
let location = Some("Vienna");

module Venue = {
  let secretCode = c =>
    switch (c) {
    | 0 => "Turn on the mic"
    | 1 => "Turn off the mic"
    | 3 => "Start the slides"

    | _ => "Talk to organizer"
    };

  /* important, grouped let statements */
  let venuePassword = 123;
  let contact = ["ryyppy", "nikgraf", "okonetchnikov"];
};
```

This change was very complex to implement; please thank [Iwan](https://twitter.com/_iwan_refmt), our `refmt` expert.

## Semicolon Relaxation

Ever gotten those cryptic syntax errors when you write this?

```reason
let a = 1
let b = 2
```

**We now gracefully accept this**! No more semicolon syntax errors.

However, for good measure, `refmt` will still print it into:

```reason
let a = 1;
let b = 2;
```

Because we're hesitant to recommend the former for now. Under the current syntax, some semicolons are still hard to remove completely. We'll keep working on this; in the meantime, do write in the latter style. If you forget a semicolon, `refmt` will  add it back.

This improvement is made by [Fred](https://twitter.com/let_def) (Merlin, Reason 3, and many others). Another very challenging change.

## Unicode String Printing

```reason
let message = "Hi! Unicode formats correctly now. Sorry for the wait ðŸ˜…"
```

Note that to _compile_ to the correct unicode string to JavaScript, you'd still need to use BuckleScript's `{js|foo|js}` [interpolation feature](https://bucklescript.github.io/docs/en/common-data-types.html#unicode-support). We'll try to unify the effort here.

Again, by Fred. Thanks!
