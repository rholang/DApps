title: New ReasonReact version released
---

Very exciting release! Short version: ReasonReact now has its own documentation site [here](//reasonml.github.io/reason-react/). Accompanying this is the new [BuckleScript](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bs-platform) release. Both are non-breaking.

Enjoy!
0.1.4 is released! We've got a new documentation website here, a brand new ReasonReact API, a smooth migration guide, and best of all: **no breaking change**! Head over to [HISTORY.md](https://github.com/reasonml/reason-react/blob/master/HISTORY.md#014) for the incremental migration.
