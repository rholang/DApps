## Your Contribution Opportunities

Wanna help?

- **Working on Windows**? Please help us improve the [Windows tooling support](https://github.com/reasonml/reasonml.github.io/issues/195)!
- [Improve the documentation and website](https://github.com/reasonml/reasonml.github.io/issues).
- [Help us translate the docs!](https://github.com/reasonml/reasonml.github.io/issues/3)
- [Suggest better error messages](https://github.com/reasonml-community/error-message-improvement/issues)
- Contribute to [your favorite editor plugin for Reason](editor-plugins.md#officially-supported-editors)
- On that note: better [ocaml-language-server](https://github.com/freebroccolo/ocaml-language-server). This will potentially power all our editor integration in the future.
- Come up with more [project names starting with "re"](https://github.com/reasonml/ideas-for-project-names-starting-with-re)
- Make wrappers for existing libraries! Have a look at our [Redex](https://redex.github.io/); see if there's something missing or unfinished, then just get your hands dirty! Most of them could also use better documentation, not just more code.
- Whatever project you'd normally do in JavaScript, try it in Reason + BuckleScript!
- Talk about Reason and BuckleScript!
- Ping @chenglou on [Forum](https://reasonml.chat) and on [Discord](https://discord.gg/reasonml) for more tasks.
